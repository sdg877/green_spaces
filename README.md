Timeframe
This project was built over several weeks, with a focus on clean functionality, good user experience, and responsiveness.
Technologies Used
Python and Flask – For the backend API


React – Main framework for the frontend


JavaScript – Core frontend language


HTML and CSS – For structuring and styling


Leaflet and OpenStreetMap – For map rendering


Fetch API – To connect frontend and backend


Pytest – For backend testing


Dotenv – For managing environment variables


Render – For deployment


Brief
The application provides:
A list of parks searchable by name


A dropdown filter for park type


A responsive map view displaying parks using polygons


Live integration between frontend and backend


A structure that allows for easy scaling and additions


Code Process
Set up the Flask backend and created an endpoint to serve park data


Used a JSON file to store and load park coordinates and details


Built the React frontend with components for search, filter, list and map


Connected the frontend to the backend using fetch requests


Added interactivity using Leaflet and map markers/polygons


Wrote a basic backend test using Pytest


Prepared the application for deployment on Render


Managed the environment variables securely


Ensured a clean and maintainable codebase


Challenges
Managing park polygons dynamically on the map


Handling frontend state updates to sync filtering and map display


Deciding on an efficient structure to manage both frontend and backend together


Wins
Built an interactive map that updates based on user input


Combined backend data with a smooth React user interface


Ensured the application is easy to deploy and maintain


Included basic testing for future scalability


Key Learnings


Gained confidence using Leaflet for custom map features


Learned how to handle and display spatial data


Understood how to use environment variables across projects


Future Improvements
Add more filtering options such as borough or amenities


Enable user submissions or reviews


Store park data in a database rather than a static file


Write tests for the frontend


Add loading indicators and error handling
